# Executors: hub daemon + process-isolated execution (background jobs, foreground commands)

Status: **DESIGN; implementation started** (2026-10-22): phase 1 = `JobProcess` (§6). Originally written for
`&` only; generalised to *all* execution in §4.2 (the daemon becomes a pure hub). Supersedes the in-process runspace-pool runner
(`Invoke-BashBackground`, `src/PsBash.Module/PsBash.psm1`). Companion to
[host-lifecycle-contract.md](host-lifecycle-contract.md) (daemon, exec gate, nested hosts) and
[pty.md](pty.md) (interactive hosts).

## 1. Problem

bash implements `cmd &` with `fork()`: the child gets a **copy** of the whole shell (variables,
functions, cwd, options, traps, open fds) and nothing it does is visible to the parent. ps-bash runs the
job as a PowerShell pipeline in a **second runspace of the same process**. Everything a bash job is
supposed to have a private copy of is shared or missing:

| Behaviour | bash | ps-bash today (after the 2026-10 patch: env restored at job end) |
|---|---|---|
| Job writes `x` ; parent reads after `wait` | parent's value | parent's value (patched) |
| Parent reads `x` while job runs | parent's value | **job's value** (shared `$env:`) |
| Parent changes `x` after launching | job still sees the old value | **job sees the new value** |
| Job calls a shell function | works | **fails**: "f is not recognized" (pool runspace never saw it) |
| `{ x=1; } \| cat` | `x` unchanged | **changed** (same mechanism, pipeline stages) |
| `$!`, `kill %1`, `kill $!` | real pid, real signal | synthetic id 1000+, `PowerShell.Stop()` |
| Job output | live, interleaved | **buffered until `wait`** |
| `wait`/`$?` | job's status | job's status (patched) |
| `cmd &` then script/`-c` ends | job keeps running | **killed** (`Remove-BashBgState` at runspace discard) |

### 1.1 Why the daemon made this a correctness bug, not a quirk

The daemon (`ps-bash-host`, `Lifetime.Daemon`) serializes command execution on one process-wide gate,
`SdkWorker._globalExecGate`, **because env and cwd are process-global** (host-lifecycle-contract.md,
"Isolated runspaces, serialized execution"). A background runspace runs **outside that gate**, so it:

1. mutates `$env:` / cwd **while another connection's command is executing under the gate** — a job from
   session A can change the variables session B's command is reading (cross-session corruption, not just
   a parent/child race);
2. outlives its command's gate hold, so its writes land between unrelated later commands;
3. is torn down by `Remove-BashBgState` when the pooled runspace is discarded — so the daemon's
   "discard on release" isolation silently turned every unwaited `&` into a kill.

The daemon's own isolation story (one runspace per connection, discarded on release) is only true for
foreground work. `&` was never moved onto the same footing. This design does that.

## 2. Goals / non-goals

Goals
- A job has **fork semantics**: a snapshot of shell state at the `&`, with no write path back.
- A job never executes inside the daemon process, so it needs no exec gate and cannot touch any other
  session's state.
- Real OS pids for `$!`/`jobs -p`/`kill`; signals and tree-kill work on Windows, Linux and macOS.
- Live output relay; correct `wait`, `$?`, `set -e`, `wait -n`, `jobs`, `disown`, `fg`, `bg`.
- **No orphaned or leaked processes**: on command end, client disconnect, daemon exit, daemon crash,
  launcher kill, host restart. Each of these has a defined, tested outcome (§6).
- Common cases (`sleep 5 &`, `./server &`, `make &`) stay cheap.

Non-goals
- Sharing live fds/pipes across the fork (`exec 3>f; cmd 3>&- &` subtleties) beyond redirections the
  emitter can express; `coproc` (separate work item).
- Making the *foreground* subshell/pipeline-stage case (`( x=2 )`, `{ x=2; } | cat`) concurrent. Subshells
  already work by save/restore (`PsBuild.ShellStateScope`) because nothing runs at the same time. The
  pipeline-stage leak in §1 is a separate, smaller fix that reuses that mechanism.

## 3. Semantics contract (what "correct" means)

1. **Snapshot at `&`.** State is captured on the thread that executes the `&` statement, before it
   returns. Later parent writes are invisible to the job and vice versa.
2. **Identity.** `$$` stays the *parent shell's* id in the job; `$BASHPID` is the job's own. `$!` in the
   parent is the job's OS pid.
3. **stdin.** A non-interactive job's stdin is `/dev/null` (NUL) unless redirected; an interactive one
   inherits the terminal (and gets SIGTTIN semantics only where the OS has them).
4. **Status.** `wait N` returns the job's exit status (128+signal on kill); unknown pid → 127;
   `wait` with no args → 0; `wait -n` → first finisher. `set -e` sees that status.
5. **Lifetime.** A job is not waited for at command end (bash behaviour). Output produced after the
   launching connection is gone is discarded (as with a closed pipe), unless the job redirected it. This
   is a deliberate improvement over today's kill; see Open questions Q1.
6. **Signals.** `kill`, `kill %n`, `disown`, `trap ... EXIT` in the job, SIGHUP on shell exit only for
   interactive hosts with `huponexit`.

## 4. Architecture

```
parent runspace (inside daemon or interactive host)
   │  `&` statement (emitted: Invoke-BashBackground { body })
   │   1. BashStateSnapshot.Capture()  ── text prelude + env block         (§5)
   │   2. ExecutorPool.Lease()        ── idle, scrubbed executor process (§4.2, §7)
   │   3. send Mode.Command(prelude + body, environment, session) over a private AF_UNIX endpoint
   ▼
job host  = ps-bash-host --job --launcher-pid=<parent host pid>      (own process, own runspace,
   │          own env/cwd, own exec gate; never touches the parent)
   │   runs the body, streams STDOUT/STDERR/EXIT frames
   ▼
JobRegistry (parent host)  ── per-job: OS pid + start-time identity, connection, TaskCompletionSource<int>,
                              relay pump → the owning connection's output sinks (live)
```

### 4.2 Generalisation: the daemon is a pure hub, every command runs in an *executor*

A job host is just an **executor**: a `ps-bash-host --executor` process that runs one command at a time
in its own env/cwd. Once that exists, nothing needs to run inside the daemon:

```
launcher ──ACQUIRE(session, buildId)──▶ HUB (daemon: no user state, no exec gate)
                                          │ picks an idle executor (or spawns one), leases it
launcher ◀──── executor endpoint ─────────┘
launcher ══ Command / STDIN / output frames, directly ══▶ EXECUTOR  (own process)
                                          hub: pool, health, idle shutdown, job registry, reaper
```

- **Broker, not proxy.** The hub never relays command traffic; it hands the launcher a private endpoint.
  Warm path cost = one tiny `ACQUIRE` round trip on a local socket (sub-millisecond) plus one connect.
  No fd passing (Windows AF_UNIX fd duplication is not something to depend on).
- **The exec gate disappears.** `SdkWorker._globalExecGate` exists only because env/cwd are
  process-global; with one command per executor process it has no purpose. Concurrent launchers run in
  parallel on different executors. The nested-host machinery (`PSBASH_INSIDE_HOST`, `-nested<d>`
  endpoints) existed to dodge that gate and is deleted at the end of the migration.
- **Crash containment.** A runaway or poisoned command costs one executor (kill tree, respawn). The hub
  holds no user state, so "host must survive any input" reduces to "the hub must survive"; the
  `NestingGuard`/watchdog logic stays in the executor as defence in depth.
- **Executors are reusable, not single-use.** A process has exactly one user at a time, so state cannot
  interleave. After a command the executor **scrubs** (environment replaced by the next request's block —
  the existing "R06 environment reset" in `SdkWorker.RunCommand` — cwd reset, shell globals reset, a fresh
  runspace taken from the executor's own in-process warm spare) and returns to the hub's idle list. It is
  **retired** (killed, not recycled) after: `PSBASH_EXECUTOR_MAX_COMMANDS` (default 200), any
  cancel/timeout/stuck/OOM/unclean exit, RSS above `PSBASH_EXECUTOR_MAX_MB`, a build-identity change, or a
  command that started a detached job (the job keeps the executor, see §6.2). Retire-and-respawn happens off
  the critical path.
- **Fresh state per command by default** (bash `-c` semantics; fixes the documented leak where `export X`
  survives into the next `-c`). Opt-in `PSBASH_SESSION_EXECUTOR=1` pins one executor to a session and skips
  the scrub for harnesses that rely on cwd/export persistence.
- **Jobs are executors.** `&` leases an executor exactly like a foreground command, preloaded with the
  snapshot (§5); when the job ends the executor is scrubbed and returned to the pool.

Why a **separate host process** and not a thread/runspace/AppDomain: env and cwd are process-global on
every OS (`Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable`, `chdir`), and bash scalar variables *are* env vars here
(`BashVariableStore`). Only a process boundary gives a private env and cwd. A per-job `Env:` provider
overlay was evaluated and rejected: native children and the C# cmdlets read the real process
environment, so the overlay would be invisible to exactly the code that needs it.

Reuse, not new machinery: the job host is the existing `ps-bash-host` binary started with
`Lifetime.PerInvocation`-style semantics (private endpoint, `--launcher-pid`, owned by its spawner),
speaking the existing framed protocol (`Mode.Command` already carries an `environment` block, a session
id, and `StdinFollows`). New protocol surface is limited to: a `--job` flag (suppresses interactive
setup, applies the snapshot), and an optional `STATE-FILE:` request field for large snapshots (the wire
line cap is `HostProtocol.MaxLineBytes` = 1 MB).

### 4.1 Native fast path (phase 2)

If the job body is one simple command that resolves (at run time, via command resolution, after
considering functions/aliases) to an **external program**, skip the job host: spawn the program directly
with the snapshot environment, cwd and redirections, under the same process-management primitives (§6).
`sleep`, servers, `make`, `ffmpeg` etc. then cost one `CreateProcess`/`posix_spawn`, not a host. The
snapshot still comes from the same capture code, so behaviour is identical by construction.

## 5. State snapshot

`BashShellState` (`src/PsBash.Cmdlets/BashShellState.cs`) already enumerates what a *subshell* must
not leak; the snapshot is the same inventory, serialised instead of saved in memory. Inventory
(extends `BashShellState.GlobalNames` and is guarded by a test that fails when new global shell state
appears without an explicit snapshot/not-snapshotted decision — the `BashVariableStoreGuardTests` pattern):

| State | Carried by |
|---|---|
| Scalars + exports | `environment` block (`BashVariableStore.Enumerate()`); host-config vars (`PSBASH_*`) are excluded/overridden, as `SdkWorker`'s environment reset does today |
| Arrays, associative arrays, `declare` attributes (`-i -r -x -l -u -n`) | prelude statements built with `PsBuild.SingleQuote` (never hand concatenation) |
| Functions | `function name { <ScriptBlock.Ast.Extent text> }` for every non-module function; **all** are sent (static analysis cannot see `eval`, indirect calls, `source`d files) |
| Aliases (`shopt expand_aliases` honoured) | prelude |
| Positional parameters, `$0`, `$-`, `IFS`, `set` options (`errexit`, `nounset`, `pipefail`, `xtrace`), `shopt` table | prelude via the `GlobalNames` list |
| cwd | request field; job host `chdir`s before the body |
| `$?`, `$_`, `$$`, `$BASHPID` | prelude; `$$` fixed to the parent's id |
| Traps | **not** inherited (bash resets caught traps in subshells); ignored (`trap '' SIG`) are |
| Open fds beyond 0/1/2 | not supported v1; emitter rejects with a clear error rather than silently dropping |

Size: functions + arrays can exceed 1 MB for large scripts → spill to a 0700 temp file in the runtime
dir (`PsBashRuntimeDirectory`), referenced by `STATE-FILE:`; deleted by the job host after load and by
the registry on job end.

A snapshot that cannot be serialised is a hard error (`bash: cannot run in background: <reason>`, exit
1) — never a silent drop. During rollout `PSBASH_BG_MODE=inproc` keeps the legacy runner as an escape
hatch (§10).

## 6. Process management (cross-platform)

This is the part that has historically gone wrong in this repo (see memory notes: Windows has no SIGHUP
or process-group inheritance; `Process.Start` always inherits handles on Windows; daemon pipe-inheritance
hang). Rules below are requirements, each with a test (§9).

### 6.1 Primitive matrix

| Concern | Windows | Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spawn | `WindowsHostSpawn` (CreateProcessW + `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST`, no handle inheritance); flags `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`, `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`, `CREATE_SUSPENDED` | `posix_spawn` with `POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP` (own process group); CLOEXEC everywhere | same as Linux |
| Contain the tree | **one Job Object per job**, assigned while suspended, then resumed (no race where a grandchild escapes before assignment); `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`; `BREAKAWAY` *not* allowed | process group (`killpg`); optional cgroup-v2 / `PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER` is a future hardening | process group (`killpg`) |
| Die with the daemon | Job Object held by the daemon (closing the handle kills the job) **and** `ParentDeathWatcher` in the job host (`--launcher-pid`) | `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG)` is unavailable through `posix_spawn`; use `ParentDeathWatcher` (poll 200 ms) + daemon graceful-shutdown `killpg` | `ParentDeathWatcher` + graceful-shutdown `killpg` (no PDEATHSIG on macOS) |
| Graceful stop (`kill`, TERM) | `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` to the job's process group, grace period, then `TerminateJobObject` | `killpg(pgid, SIGTERM)`, grace, `SIGKILL` | same |
| Hard stop | `TerminateJobObject` | `killpg(pgid, SIGKILL)` | same |
| Stop/continue (`Ctrl-Z`, `bg`) | no OS equivalent: `NtSuspendProcess` over the job's processes (documented limitation: not for protected processes) | `SIGSTOP`/`SIGCONT` | same |
| Exit status | `GetExitCodeProcess`; killed-by-us reported as 128+15/137 to match shells | `waitpid` via .NET `Process`; signal → 128+n | same |
| Reap | `Process` handle disposed on completion; no zombies on Windows | `Process.WaitForExitAsync` on every job so SIGCHLD is consumed — **no zombies** | same |
| Identity (PID reuse) | `ProcessIdentity` (pid + creation time) checked before every signal/kill and on registry reload | pid + `/proc/<pid>/stat` starttime | pid + `proc_pidinfo` start time |
| Window flashes | `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (see memory: codex-window-flashes) | n/a | n/a |

Everything above is wrapped in one `JobProcess` abstraction in `PsBash.Core/Runtime` with
`Spawn / Signal(sig) / Kill(tree) / Suspend / Resume / WaitAsync / Identity`, one implementation per OS
behind a shared contract test-suite. `BashRuntime.RunChildProcess` (buffered, timeout, `Kill(entireProcessTree)`)
stays for buffered tools; its own comment already notes the tree-kill guarantee needs Job Object/pgrp —
`JobProcess` is that guarantee and `RunChildProcess` should adopt it afterwards.

### 6.2 Lifecycle table — every way a job can end, and what happens

| Event | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Job exits | status stored; registry entry kept until `wait`/`jobs` reports it (bash "Done"); handles/state-file released at once |
| Launching **command ends** (script `exit`, `-c` returns) | job keeps running, detached from the connection; output discarded; stays owned by the daemon (daemon idle-shutdown is deferred while jobs are alive, bounded by `PSBASH_JOB_MAX_DETACHED_SECS`) |
| **Client disconnects** (Connection watchdog fires) | same as above — a dead launcher is not a dead job (matches `nohup`-less bash on a closed pipe: job gets EPIPE on write) |
| **Command cancelled/timed out** (`StuckCommandWatchdog`, tool timeout) | jobs of that connection are tree-killed: a cancelled command must not leave work behind |
| Session anchor exits (`SessionAnchorWatcher`) | the 5 s idle shortening applies only when no jobs are alive; with jobs, daemon waits up to the detached cap, then tree-kills and exits |
| `ps-bash host restart` / obsolete-build replacement | graceful: SIGTERM/CTRL_BREAK to all jobs, grace 5 s, hard kill; registry cleared |
| Daemon **crash / kill -9 / TerminateProcess** | Windows: Job Object handle closes → OS kills the trees. POSIX: job hosts see the parent gone via `ParentDeathWatcher` (≤200 ms) and tree-kill themselves; plus the reaper below |
| Job host **crash** | parent sees EXIT-less EOF → status 255, "job host terminated unexpectedly" on stderr, entry completed, tree-killed |
| Reboot / logout | nothing survives; sidecars are stale and reaped |

**Orphan reaping.** Each live job writes `<runtime dir>/jobs/<daemon-endpoint-hash>.<jobid>.json`
(pid, start-time identity, owner uid/SID, parent daemon pid+identity), 0600, beside the host sidecars.
`StaleArtifactReaper` is extended with the same compare-then-delete rule it uses for host sidecars: a job
whose recorded parent daemon is provably dead **and** whose own pid still matches the recorded identity
**and** whose owner is the current user is killed (tree) and its sidecar removed; anything that fails
a check is left alone ("Unsafe to touch"). `ps-bash host reap` runs it on demand; daemon startup runs it.

### 6.3 Handle, fd and stdio hygiene

- Job hosts are spawned through `WindowsHostSpawn` on Windows (explicit handle list). Never
  `Process.Start` for a long-lived child (documented leak: pipe-inheritance hang).
- Host stdio of a job host is redirected to pipes owned by the daemon and drained to null, exactly as
  `IpcWorker.SpawnAndWaitAsync` does for daemons; job I/O travels on the framed IPC connection, not on
  the process's stdio.
- The daemon's listening sockets and the launcher's std handles must be CLOEXEC / non-inheritable at
  spawn time; a test spawns a job and asserts the job host holds none of them.

### 6.4 Resource limits

- `PSBASH_JOBS_MAX` (default 32) concurrent job hosts per daemon; the 33rd `&` fails like a failed fork
  (`bash: fork: Resource temporarily unavailable`, status 1) instead of exhausting memory
  (a host is tens of MB of RSS). `HostMemoryGuard` already exists for the host process; the pool
  consults it before warming a spare.
- Output relay is back-pressured per job (bounded queue, same `IpcOutputQueue` rules): a job producing
  output with nobody reading cannot grow the daemon without bound; the existing stall timeout applies.
- Detached-job cap `PSBASH_JOB_MAX_DETACHED_SECS` (default 0 = unlimited while the daemon lives, but the
  daemon exits with its session anchor).

## 7. Performance — warm execution must not regress

### 7.1 Baseline (2026-10-22, Windows 11, installed release, machine at ~80 % CPU — treat as upper bounds)

| Measurement | min / p50 / p90 (ms) |
|---|---|
| floor: `cmd /c exit` | 15 / 19 / 59 |
| floor: `pwsh -NoProfile -c 1` (cold PowerShell) | 500 / 571 / 599 |
| launcher alone: `ps-bash --version` | 97 / 123 / 220 |
| warm daemon, back-to-back: `ps-bash -c 'echo hi'` | 430 / 516 / 578 |
| warm daemon, 2 s idle gap between calls | ≈ 246–370 |

Reading: the launcher costs ~100–120 ms; the rest (~130–250 ms) is connect + transpile + execute + release.
**Back-to-back calls are 150–250 ms slower than spaced calls**: discarding the used runspace starts
re-warming a replacement (psm1 import) *while the next command runs*, so warm-up competes with the
foreground command for CPU. That is the thing to fix, and the executor model must not make it worse.

### 7.2 Design rules that protect the warm path

1. **Reuse, don't respawn** (§4.2). A recycled executor has zero warm-up cost; process spawn + psm1 import
   (~1 s+ CPU) only happens when concurrency exceeds the idle pool or an executor is retired.
2. **Spares are paid for off the critical path and at low priority.** Replacement warm-up runs at
   below-normal priority (`SetPriorityClass` / `nice`), is delayed until the pool has been quiet for
   ~50 ms, and never starts a spare while a lease is in flight. Burst arrivals are served from the idle
   list (`PSBASH_EXECUTOR_WARM`, default 2) before any spawn.
3. **In-executor warm runspace.** Each executor keeps one pre-imported spare runspace, so the scrub is a
   swap, not an import. This removes the back-to-back penalty in §7.1 even for the current design.
4. **Broker round trip only.** `ACQUIRE` reply carries the endpoint *and* the executor's build identity, so
   the launcher skips the separate health handshake it does today.
5. **Launcher-side:** no change in this design; the ~100 ms launcher floor is tracked separately (AOT
   startup, module probe) and is where the next big win is.
6. **Native fast path** (§4.1) for single external-program jobs: one `CreateProcess`/`posix_spawn`.
7. **Memory guard.** `HostMemoryGuard` gates spare creation; idle executors above `PSBASH_EXECUTOR_WARM`
   are reaped after `PSBASH_EXECUTOR_IDLE_SECS` (default 60) so a quiet session returns to hub + 1 spare.

### 7.3 Acceptance bars (measured with the harness `scripts/bench-warm.ps1`, same machine, A/B vs the release)

- warm `-c 'echo hi'`, back-to-back p50 **≤ 0.8×** today's; spaced p50 **≤ 1.05×** today's;
- 4 concurrent launchers: wall time ≤ 1.3× a single command (today: ≥ 4× because of the gate);
- `{ :; } & wait` within the same budget as a foreground command; `sleep 1 & wait` ≤ `sleep 1` + 50 ms;
- steady-state RSS: hub + `WARM` executors ≤ today's single host + 60 MB;
- cold first call (no daemon) not worse than today.

## 8. Shell surface changes

| Item | Change |
|---|---|
| `Invoke-BashBackground` | becomes a thin call into `JobRegistry` (C#); emitter output unchanged |
| `$!`, `$BASHPID`, `jobs -p` | real pids |
| `wait [-n] [-f] [id…]`, `wait %n`, `wait` | registry-backed; real exit statuses; `127` for unknown |
| `jobs [-lp]`, `fg`, `bg`, `disown [-ah]`, `kill [-s sig] %n \| pid` | `kill` of a registry pid routes through `JobProcess.Signal` (tree-aware); other pids use the OS directly |
| Pipeline stages with side effects (`{ x=1; } \| cat`) | out of scope here; fix with `ShellStateScope` per stage (separate task) |
| `Remove-BashBgState` / pool teardown in `SdkRunspace` | replaced by `JobRegistry.OnConnectionEnd(policy)` per §6.2 |

## 9. Test plan (every bullet is a named test)

Differential (bash = oracle, `AssertOracle`): the table in §1 verbatim; function-in-job; array/assoc in
job; `set -e` + `wait`; `wait -n`; `$!`/`kill $!`/`kill %1` observable effects; subshell-with-`&`;
`cd` in job; positional params in job; IFS in job; `trap` inheritance; job stdin is /dev/null;
`$$` vs `$BASHPID`.

Process management (run on Windows, Linux, macOS CI; each asserts via OS process queries, not logs):
- kill tree: job spawning grandchildren; `kill $!` leaves **zero** descendants (poll with deadline).
- daemon killed hard (`TerminateProcess`/`SIGKILL`): all job trees gone within 2 s.
- launcher killed / client disconnect: job survives; command cancel: job tree dies.
- no zombies after 100 short jobs (POSIX: scan `/proc` or `ps` for `Z`); handle count flat on Windows.
- PID reuse: forged registry entry with a live-but-different process is **not** killed.
- orphan reaper: stale sidecar for a dead parent kills the orphan; foreign-owner sidecar is untouched.
- handle hygiene: job host holds no daemon socket / launcher std handle (extends
  `Daemon_Spawn_DoesNotInheritStrayLauncherHandles`).
- fork-bomb guard: `for i in $(seq 100); do sleep 30 & done` → exactly `PSBASH_JOBS_MAX` succeed, rest
  fail with status 1, daemon RSS bounded.
- cross-session isolation (the §1.1 bug): session A job loops writing `x`; session B's command asserts
  `x` unchanged for its whole run.
- exec-gate independence: a 30 s job does not delay another connection's command.
- Windows: no console window created; `CTRL_BREAK` graceful path and `TerminateJobObject` fallback.
- Inventory guard: new `$global:` shell state without a snapshot decision fails the build.

Pester (release gate): direct-cmdlet `Invoke-BashWait`/`Invoke-BashJobs` surface in module (non-daemon) mode,
which needs the in-process fallback (§10) or a module-mode job-host spawner.

## 10. Rollout

0. **Measure**: baseline recorded in §7.1; add `scripts/bench-warm.ps1` and re-run after every phase.
1. `JobProcess` + contract tests on all three OSes (no behaviour change).
2. `BashStateSnapshot` + inventory guard; `--job` host mode; `JobRegistry`; flag
   `PSBASH_BG_MODE=process` opt-in; differential tests green.
3. Warm spare + native fast path; perf bar met.
4. Orphan reaper + lifecycle table tests; interactive-host integration (fg/bg/Ctrl-Z).
5. Default flips to `process`; `inproc` retained one release behind `PSBASH_BG_MODE=inproc`, then deleted
   along with the runspace pool and `Remove-BashBgState`.
6. **Foreground migration** (§4.2): `ACQUIRE` broker handshake; foreground commands lease executors behind
   `PSBASH_EXEC_MODE=executor`; A/B against §7.3 bars; flip default; then delete `_globalExecGate`, the
   nested-host endpoints and `PSBASH_INSIDE_HOST` handling.

Module mode (plain `Import-Module PsBash`, no daemon): the module spawns job hosts through the same
`JobProcess`; if the host binary is not discoverable it falls back to `inproc` with a one-time warning.

## 11. Open questions

- **Q1 — detach vs kill at command end.** bash lets the job continue; today's ps-bash kills it. Agent
  harnesses may *rely* on cleanup. Proposal: detach (bash-correct) with the daemon's session-anchor
  shutdown as the backstop, plus `PSBASH_BG_ON_EXIT=kill` for harnesses that want the old behaviour.
- **Q2 — fd inheritance (`3>file` into jobs).** Rejecting at emit time is safe but may break scripts that
  pass fds to jobs; survey the real-world `.sh` corpus before deciding.
- **Q3 — cgroup/subreaper hardening on Linux** for jobs that `setsid` out of the process group.
  Windows Job Objects already prevent escape; POSIX double-fork daemons can. Worth it?
- **Q4 — Windows suspend for `Ctrl-Z`.** `NtSuspendProcess` is undocumented; acceptable, or limit
  `Ctrl-Z` job control to POSIX and document it in `intentional-differences.md`?

## 11. Implementation status

Shipped (uncommitted at time of writing):

- **Phase 1** `JobProcess` (Windows `CreateProcessW` + kill-on-close Job Object; POSIX `posix_spawnp` + own pgroup), contract tests.
- **Phase 2/3 (jobs only)** `cmd &` runs in a private `ps-bash-host` (`BashJobProcess`), seeded by `BashStateSnapshot`
  (cwd, shell globals, shopt, functions, arrays; scalars travel as the request environment). `$!` is the real pid,
  `kill $!` kills the tree and `wait` returns 128+signal, `wait` returns the job status and honours errexit,
  parent/child assignments are isolated both ways. `JobHostSpares` keeps up to 2 warm hosts (adaptive, 60 s expiry),
  pre-warmed when a command contains `Invoke-BashBackground`.
- **Opt-in, default NOT flipped**: `PSBASH_BG_MODE=process` selects it; the default stays `inproc`.
  `scripts/bench-warm.ps1` (Debug build copied to a scratch dir, loaded machine, p50 ms, inproc -> process), after the
  prelude fix below: `sleep 1 & wait` 1391 -> 1484 (bar: fg `sleep 1` 1292 + 50), `{ :; } & wait` 320 -> 2595
  (min 388: bimodal, a miss when back-to-back jobs outrun the ~2 s spare refill), back-to-back echo 276 -> 278,
  spaced echo 210 -> 273, 4 concurrent 1761 -> 2164 (1.23x). The cold-miss case still fails the section 7.3 bar.
- **Prelude fix (the big one)**: the job prelude carried every runtime helper function (115 KB, ~1 s to execute in the
  job host). `$global:__BashBaselineFunctions` (captured at the end of the psm1) lists the runtime's own functions; the
  snapshot skips them, so only user functions travel (1.6 KB, job execution ~1000 ms -> ~45 ms).
- Spares are warmed with a real `Invoke-Bash*` call before they count as ready (`JobHostSpares.StartWarmAsync`).
- Guards: `ShellStateInventoryGuardTests` (every shell-state global is carried or listed as not inherited).

Known gaps / not done:

- A cold (missed) job start is ~2.5 s on a loaded machine; the numbers above are Debug-build and load bound, so re-run
  `scripts/bench-warm.ps1` A/B on a quiet machine with a release build before deciding the flip.
- Job output is buffered until `wait`/completion; jobs are killed at command end (Q1 detach not implemented).
- `PSBASH_JOBS_MAX` (default 32) is enforced in `BashJobProcess.Start`. No POSIX hard-kill containment (Q3), no native fast path.
- `JobHostSpares.Prewarm(n)` sizes the spare pool from the number of `Invoke-BashBackground` call sites in the command
  (bounded by `MaxSpares`), so a command with several `&` starts its spares before the first one is reached. Effect on the
  cold-miss bar is NOT yet measured: the only run after the change was on a saturated machine (echo p50 1023 ms vs 278 ms)
  and is not comparable. Re-run `scripts/bench-warm.ps1` on a quiet machine before deciding the default flip.
- A/B on the same Debug binary, back to back, machine at ~55% CPU (p50 ms, inproc -> process, 8 runs each):
  `{ :; } & wait` 935 -> 3505 (3.7x; bar 1.05x), `sleep 1 & wait` 1898 -> 2287 (fg `sleep 1` 1848, bar +50 ms),
  4 concurrent 7282 -> 4139 (batch wall, noisy). Process mode still misses the cold-miss bars even with the
  spare pool sized from the command, so the default stays `inproc` and Phase 6 (which this design gates on the
  bars) is not started. The remaining cost is a job host's start (process + runspace), not the prelude.
- Orphan tests that exist: command-end leaves no job process, and a launcher killed without cleanup leaves none
  (Windows; `BackgroundJobProcessTests`), 10 short jobs are all reaped, and a recorded identity does not match a
  different process on the same pid (`JobProcessTests`). Not written: a 100-job soak and the POSIX hard kill.
- Phase 6 (foreground executors, hub/ACQUIRE, removing `_globalExecGate` and the
  nested-host machinery) are NOT started; the daemon is still the foreground executor.
